# DSGVO-Webanalyser

### Info:
This Tool allows to you scan a website for cookies and thrid party calls.

### Idea:
The idea came, because of an Judge that started to sue differen companys because they used google fonts on their website (which is illegal in the EU). With this tool, you can scan your website for cookies and calls to third partys that are not protected by a cookie banner!

### Implementation:
The program is implemented in Python using the Selenium or the Ghost.py library. To run the programm you simply have to start the docker-compose file!

### Usage:
- Simply open localhost on port 8080 - the rest is pretty self explainable

### TODO:
- finish the frontend
